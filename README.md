This project is a challenge to the challenges taken to reinforce students' knowledge of the Rocketseat full stack course.

Simple project where I created and customized some things meeting the challenges that were requested during the course, the idea is to pull the data from Github api where it should be possible to add users and list the repositories followed by each one and clicking on repository should open a webview with the content.
